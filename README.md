Raytracer C++ framework for "Introduction to Computer Graphics"
===============================================================

This is a C++ framework for a raytracer. It is created for the Computer
Science course "Introduction to Computer Graphics" taught at the
University of Groningen by Tobias Isenberg.

Author: Maarten Everts

This framework is inspired by and uses code of the raytracer framework of
Bert Freudenberg that can be found at
<http://isgwww.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/graphik/lehre/cg2/projekt/rtprojekt.html>

Description of the included files
---------------------------------

### The raytracer source files:

main.cpp
:	Contains main(), starting point. Responsible for parsing command-line
    arguments.

raytracer.cpp/.h
:	Raytracer class. Responsible for reading the scene description, starting
    the raytracer and writing the result to an image file.

scene.cpp/.h
:	Scene class. Contains code for the actual raytracing.

image.cpp/.h
:	Image class, includes code for reading from and writing to PNG files.

light.cpp/.h
:	Light class and Ray class.

object.cpp/.h
:	Object class. Represents an object in the scene.

sphere.cpp/.h
:	Sphere class, which is a subclass of the Object class. Respresents a
    sphere in the scene.

triple.cpp/.h
:	Triple class. Represents a 3-dimensional vector which is used for colors,
    points,	and vectors. Includes a number of useful functions and operators,
    see the comments in triple.h.

### Supporting source files:

lodepng.cpp/.h
:	Code for reading from and writing to PNG files, used by the Image class.
    LodePNG is created by Lode Vandevenne and can be found at
    <http://members.gamedev.net/lode/projects/LodePNG/>.

yaml/*
:	Code for parsing YAML documents. Created by Jesse Beder, can be obtained
    from <http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/>. See also yaml/license.txt.
